    <h2>Why compute this?</h2>
    <section>
      While quality and value add are the more important metrics over time,
      lines of code is one of the few tangible artifacts that exist to give a
      birds-eye view into somebody's contributions over time. Contributions can
      be copy/pasted, faked or spoofed and easily gamed if desired, and while
      it's never going to be perfect, efforts were made here to eliminate any
      erroneous or "noisy" contributions
    </section>

      <h2>How was this computed?</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The entire github history was pulled for Adam via the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/adam-te/contributor-stats/blob/main/codeStats.ts#L22"
              >fetchGithubContributions script</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Then fairly rigorous efforts were made to eliminate any "noisy
            contributions" or false positives
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Every commit over 5,000 LoC was manually inspected for false
            positives or copy/paste style changes and excluded if relevant (See:
            below)
          </li>
          <li>
            Every file change over 1,000 LoC was manually inspected and
            explicitly ignored if not relevant (See: below)
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-logic related file extensions are explicitly ignored, including
            configuration files, such as XML and JSON, and image files (See:
            below)
          </li>
          <li>
            Forked or testing repos and associated commits are explicitly
            ignored (See: below)
          </li>
          <li>
            4 commits in this history are over 7,000 lines of code (squashed
            branches), and no other commit is over 5,000 lines of code.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
